  - Check the book ids (/books/:id) to see that it's working with mongo instead of pg

### Setup

#### `.env` requirements

- `PORT` - Port Number
- `MONGODB_URI` - URL to the running mongo instance/db
- `DATABASE_URL` - URL to the running postgre db

#### Running the app

- `npm start`
- To switch between mongo and postgre, update line 10 in router.js

```
const { getBooks, getBook, createBook, updateBook, deleteBook } = dbSelector(
  'mongo'
); // for mongoDB

const { getBooks, getBook, createBook, updateBook, deleteBook } = dbSelector(
  'pg'
); // for postgre
```
